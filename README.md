# solarpy
Learning project for OpenGL and REST API in Python.

Credit to *Lee Stemkoski, Michael Pascale* and their book **Developing Graphics Frameworks with Python and OpenGL** as well as *Alexander Vasiliev* who made it so much easier to find errors due to his [repository](https://github.com/ax-va/PyOpenGL-Pygame-Stemkoski-Pascale-2021.git)

## Dependencies
pip install ..
- numpy
- pygame
- pyopengl, pyopengl-accelerate

## Demo (solar.py)
You can switch between the stellar bodies with 1, 2 and 3. The camera will lock on but the controls are a bit wierd. Rotate with a and d as well as zoom in and out with w and s works decently.
